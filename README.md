# NanoOS
NanoOS is a small project I'm working on in my free time.
| Question | Anwser |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| How to build it? | For now I'm only uploading source files. OS is **way** to unstable so for now you can only see source code. *(you can try and figure out how to compile it, goodluck)* |
| When will it be available? | I don't know. |
